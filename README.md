# Finite_State_Machine

In this project, controlling the retraction and extension of Airplane’s landing gear can be implemented using Finite State Machine (FSM). FSM is the most efficient algorithm which is mathematical model of computation. Controlling the direction of Valve. Controlling the retraction and extension of Airplane’s landing gear.
